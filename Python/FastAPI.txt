Concurrency and async / await
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
○	await can only be used inside of functions created with async def
	...
	async def <function-name>():
		<var> = await <do-something>()


• 	Type Hints → Type Annotations
•	special syntax that allow declaring the type of a variable
 editors and tools can give you better support.




❓ If your application (somehow) doesn't have to communicate with anything else and wait for it to respond, use async def.
