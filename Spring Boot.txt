	â—‹	Presentation
	â—‹	Service
	â—‹ 	Persistence

	The presentation layer should never talk directly to the persistence layer

â€¢	Modularity

â€¢	Component Scanning 
	- A process that starts when the application starts-up
	- Look throughout the project â†’ Beans and where Beans are Needed
	â—‹ Injects required dependencies as a part of the process and this is known
	as Auto-Wiring
	â—‹ Starts at a particular point in the project hierarchy and works its way 
	down the tree
	â—‹ Traditionally, in Spring, we need to tell the application the starting
	point using the @ComponentScan annotation. In the Spring-Boot world, we 
	start from the class which is marked as @SpringBootApplication. The
	@SpringBootApplication annotation contains the @ComponentScan annotation

â€¢	Auto-Configuration

	Process that Spring Boot uses when it starts up to provide "sensible" 
	defaults and create dependencies
	
	Spring Boot "Starters" are a collection of Dependencies, each of which is 
	tailored to solve a particular problem
