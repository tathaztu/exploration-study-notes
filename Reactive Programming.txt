•   Microservices Architecture often entails several network calls.
    Network calls are slow > Threads remain idle
    Developers create multiple threads compensate and maximize CPU Utilization
•   Threads are Expensive!
•   Expensive = Heavy/Consumes Memory

The processor class acts as both Publisher and Subscriber

public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<R> {

We can have a hierarchy like, e.g.

Reactor is a fully non-blocking, reactive programming library for building
efficient and scalable applications on the JVM, based on the Reactive Streams
specification.
It provides composable APIs (Flux for 0-N items and Mono for 0-1 item) to manage
asynchronous data streams with backpressure support.

•   Subscriber has to subscribe and request for the producer to produce items.
    The idea is to be lazy
•   Subscriber can cancel anytime.
•   If there are no Subscribers left, then the Producer will not produce anything
•   Producer will produce items via. onNext
•   Producer will call onComplete after emitting 0...N data.

    According to the 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, a 𝙿𝚞𝚋𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚑𝚎𝚛 stream must
    call the 𝚘𝚗𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚝𝚎() signal to its 𝚂𝚞𝚋𝚜𝚌𝚛𝚒𝚋𝚎𝚛 when it has successfully
    transmitted all the data and there are no more elements to emit.

    This signals the end of the stream and indicates that the Subscriber will
    not receive any further 𝚘𝚗𝙽𝚎𝚡𝚝() calls from this Publisher.

    In Reactor, both 𝙵𝚕𝚞𝚡 (for streams of 0 .. N elements) and 𝙼𝚘𝚗𝚘 (for
    streams of 0 or 1 element) will emit an 𝚘𝚗𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚝𝚎() signal under normal
    completion scenarios after all data has been emitted.

• Producer will call onError when something breaks
• Producer will not invoke anything after onComplete/onError

    𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗟𝗮𝘇𝘆.  

    Operations within a Reactive Streams Pipeline are not executed until a
    Subscriber actively subscribes to the Publisher and starts requesting data.
    The following reasons explain the behavior -

    𝗡𝗼 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗡𝗼 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸: Until a Subscriber calls the subscribe() method on
    a Publisher, the Publisher does not start producing or processing any data.

    𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗙𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Reactive Streams implementations (like Reactor and RxJava)
    often employ operator fusion techniques. This can optimize the execution by
    combining multiple operators into a single step, which only happens when the
    stream is actually consumed.  

    𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻: The Subscriber controls the rate at which it receives data
    by making explicit requests (using the request(n) method). The Publisher
    only produces and pushes data in response to this demand. This pull-based
    backpressure mechanism further reinforces the lazy nature.

    Reactive Streams set up a blueprint for data processing, but the actual
    processing is deferred until there's a consumer actively pulling the data
    through the pipeline. This lazy evaluation is crucial for efficiency,
    especially when dealing with potentially large or infinite streams of data.

    ○   A common use case of this method would be to create a Mono type
    Publisher to match the parameter(s) of a method which requires a Publisher,
    in place of the "data".
    ○   Use 'just' when the values we need to send, need to be in the memory

    𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼.𝘀𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲(𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲(𝘀))

    𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼.𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲(𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲<? 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗧> 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿)

    ○   The callable interface is a very old interface and has existed
    ○   JavaDocs

        A task that returns a result and may throw an exception. Implementors
        define a single method with no arguments called call.

        The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed
        for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread.

        A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked
        exception.

        Callable throws Exception whereas Supplier throws RuntimeException

    ○   Callable has a throws clause | Supplier doesn't

    𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼.𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗥𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲(𝗥𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲)

    ○   Perform a task and return an Mono.Empty after the Runnable, that is
        passed as a parameter has been executed

    𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼.𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲(𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲<? 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗧> 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲)

    ○   Integrate existing asynchronous operations that are based on
        CompletableFuture into a Reactor-based reactive pipeline.

    ○   If the CompletableFuture completes successfully with a value, the Mono
        will emit that value as an onNext() signal followed by an onComplete()
        signal.

    ○   If the CompletableFuture completes without a value (i.e., a
        CompletableFuture<Void>), the Mono will simply emit an onComplete()
        signal.

    ❗   CompletableFuture is not lazy. If Mono.fromFuture is associated with a
        CompletableFuture and there is no association with a subscriber, then
        that is not a Lazy computation because the computation of the
        CompletableFuture code will start immediately.

        Mono
            .fromFuture(getName());

        private static CompletableFuture<String> getName() {
            return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                logger.info("Get Name from CompletableFuture");
                return Util.faker().name().firstName();
            });
        }

    ○   CompletableFuture can be made to execute with a delay by using it in the
        form of a Supplier

        Mono
            .fromFuture(()-> getName());

    𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼.𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿(𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿<? 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗼<? 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗧>> 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿)
